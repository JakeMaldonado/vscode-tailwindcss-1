# Tailwind CSS Autocomplete for Visual Studio Code

[![The MIT License](https://flat.badgen.net/badge/license/MIT/orange)](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Currently supports [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss) v0.6.5

![demo](demo.gif)

## Features

- Supports **autocomplete** for _all_ Tailwind classes
- Supports **autocomplete** for _some_ FinanceIt components (these will be added as docs are updated)
- Reads your project's `tailwind.js` config and **reacts to changes in realtime**
  - Example: Add a new color called lilac to config for text colors and `text-lilac` will appear in autocomplete **instantly**
- Works with several languages modes including HTML, JavaScript, JavaScript React, TypeScript React, PHP, HAML, Emblem and Vue
- Supports `@apply` in CSS and SCSS files
- Supports Emmet shortcuts
- No need for generated CSS on disk for autocomplete to work (Works with **webpack dev server** too)

## Installation

Installation
Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:

Clone the repo and cd into the extension folder
run `code --install-extension vscode-tailwindcss-1.vsix`

## Configuration

There is none! üéâ

This extension reads config from the currently open project's `tailwind.js` file and that's about it

## Known Limitations

- Currently doesn't generate suggestions for Tailwind prefixes including hover, media query sizes etc
- No support for hbs
- Doesn't use the project's version of Tailwind to generate classes so if you're using an older version of Tailwind, you might see mismatched suggestions üòû
- Sorting classes is currently broken
